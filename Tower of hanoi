Approcah 
there are three rod given such as Source which has disks, second rod which is helper and third rod is Destination
Now our job is to move all disks from source disks to destination with given rules
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2) A disk can be moved only if it is on the top of a rod.
3) No disk can be placed on the top of a smaller disk.

Now approcah is transfer n-1 disks to helper and in last the single remaining to destination
again in second recursion call source don't have any disks and helper have n-1 disks, so move from helper to source and in last base case hits transfer from helper to destination
this way all disks will get transferrd

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void towerOfHanoi(int n, char s, char h, char d) {
    // Write your code here
    if(n==0)
    return;
    if (n == 1) {
      cout << s<<" "<<d<<endl;;
      return;
    }
    towerOfHanoi(n-1,  s,  d,  h);
   cout<<s<<" "<<d<<endl;
   towerOfHanoi(n-1,h,s,d);
   return;
}


int main() {
    int n;
    cin >> n;
    towerOfHanoi(n, 'a', 'b', 'c');
}
